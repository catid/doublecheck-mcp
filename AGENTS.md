# AGENTS.md instructions for doublecheck-mcp

- When proposing or executing implementation work in this repo, summarize the plan and call the `gemini_plan_check` MCP tool with the expectations; include its verdict in your response and incorporate any useful changes it suggests.
- For any code review or audit task (including repo-wide issue checks), first call `gemini_plan_check` with a short review plan/expectations, then run `sonnet_code_review` on focused code/diff snippets (prefer git diff/targeted functions; inspect and exclude any secrets such as .env, credentials, keys/tokens) with helpful context. Surface both verdicts/issues in your reply; if Gemini requests changes, note them and adjust scope while still delivering the Sonnet findings. If either tool fails or is unavailable, report the failure and keep any manual observations limited to what you can justify from the provided context.
- When writing or modifying code/scripts, run both MCP tools on the changed snippets: use `sonnet_code_review` and also call `gemini_plan_check` (with a brief plan/expectations for the code change). Consider their feedback and incorporate beneficial improvements before finalizing your answer.
- When the next step is unclear (e.g., interpreting tool output, error logs, or other ambiguous development signals), consult `gemini_plan_check` to leverage Gemini's world knowledge for guidance on how to proceed; summarize any useful direction in your reply.
- Treat reviewer feedback as guidance, not ground truth: prefer substantive issues over minor nits (style-only suggestions are non-blocking) and avoid looping on cosmetic changes unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep responses concise; surface tool outputs (especially verdicts, issues, and follow-up actions) clearly.
